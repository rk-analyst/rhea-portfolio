Leveraging risk modeling and correlation analysis, I identified the most suitable investment opportunities for each client, taking into consideration their individual risk tolerance. <br>
                          ● Significantly reduced the average risk of the clients' portfolios from 57% to 31% by rebalancing their high-risk investments. This not only led to a more stable and secure investment portfolio but also helped the clients achieve their financial goals in a more efficient and effective manner. <br> <br>
